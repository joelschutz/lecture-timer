# Lecture-Timer README

This is an extension for VSCode to help you annotate `timestamps` to `markdown` files. It's meant to:

- Take notes at classes and lectures
- Comment on podcasts and audio files
- Review videos or any kind of recording

## Features

Create timers and stamp the current time to a markdown file.

Listen to audio files and take notes on specific moments

Use the `MarkStamp` command to add a timestamp to your text. It can be an standalone stamp, an inline content or an entire text block

It uses generic markdown directives so you can export to any markdowm pos-processor

## Known Issues

- Multiple timers in the same workspace are unstable and can leak attributes between then
- No video files are supported yet
- Extension does not comply to UX guidelines
- Duration of open timers are not stored to file
